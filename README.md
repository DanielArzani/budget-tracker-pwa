# Budget Tracker Starter Code

1. When online any transaction will be added to mongo and the graph will be updated
2. Can be used offline and data is stored in IDB
3. When coming online again, data is sent from IDB to mongo and IDB is cleared of that data
4. In order to see that new data updated on the page, close the tab, change the version number of the service worker (create a new service worker) and open up the tab again, may need to refresh the page again
